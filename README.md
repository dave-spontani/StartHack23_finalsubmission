# Start_Hack_23
##Shrimp on the Moon
To begin, this project tackles the case presented by the city of St. Gallen. We propose a new solution for citizens to dispose of their bulk waste, which can be seen in the "TooGoodtoThrow Webapp_Mockup" file. Included in this is a basic "Proof-of-Concept" in the form of a webapp, which can be tested with the following link:

The code which runs the webapp can be inspected in the "main.py" file. Additionally, our code to identify points of concentration of waste disposal can be viewed in "predictor.ipynb"
